# AI Movie App ðŸŽ¬

This application is built following **Clean Architecture** principles, leveraging **Dependency Injection**, **Shared Preferences**, and **Cubit/BLoC** for state management.

The entire app is designed with scalability and maintainability in mind, following a modular structure to separate concerns and ensure clean, testable code.

---

## Project Highlights âœ¨

- **Clean Architecture** for clear separation of layers and maintainable code.
- **Dependency Injection** to manage and inject dependencies easily.
- **Cubit/BLoC** state management for predictable and testable states.
- **Shared Preferences** for lightweight persistent data storage.
- **GoRouter** for flexible and clean navigation handling.
- **Service Locator** for easy dependency management across the app.

These patterns and tools are integrated throughout the entire application from the very beginning.

## First Implemented Feature: Splash Screen âœ¨

The **Splash Screen** is the first feature added to the app.  
It handles initial routing logic through the `DecideStartDestinationUseCase` and integrates seamlessly with the appâ€™s theme system.

**Key Highlights of Splash Feature:**
- Clean routing with **GoRouter**.
- Theme initialization using **Shared Preferences** and `ThemeCubit`.
- Integrated with **Service Locator** for dependency management.
- White theme option alongside the original color palette.
- Minor structural improvements and cleanup.
